# Income Prediction Model

As a part of coursework related to the subject 'Machine Learning' in Trinity College Dublin, this project aims to train the model and predict the income of a person based on the given features. The dataset was taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcdml1920-income-ind/data. List of persons and their yearly salaries with features (e.g. age, nationality, and profession) are provided. Code contains several data imputation techniques (ffill, mean imputation, label encoding, one-hot encoding). Applied models like linear regression, random forest and KNN model using scikit learn library. Calculated RMSE (root mean square error) to get the accuracy of the income predicted Some special feature like- taking log of Income variable to scale the values and concatenating the training and test dataset to do the same data preprocessing at once.
